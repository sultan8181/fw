two R code files: 

try to train a machine learning model base on some sample data with similar datatype
to Austraila environment data, such as temperature, humidity and altitude data.
Random forest, Naive bayes, and decision tree are used.
with some viusalisation functions and model accuracy analyse functions. 

Python ML model file, include Machine learning functions also trained by sample data.
with XGboost function used.

with these models, after input with true Victoria environment data, we can use to predict
the areas which in high risky to caught fire and then we can rank these area in our aplication.
